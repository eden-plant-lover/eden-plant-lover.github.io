  <p>these are my own personal definitions! they are far from universal</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>plant</dt>
    <dd>any organism in the clade <i>embryophyta</i>. basically, a very long time ago some green algae started growing on land. plants are them, and all of their descendants, even ones that don't photosynthesize. and i don't could other photosynthesizers as plants, even, like, lichens and seaweed</dd>
    <dt>gametophyte</dt>
    <dd>the generation of plants that produces gametes. these gametes then combine to form the zygote of the sporophyte. these are often haploid (1 set of chromosomes), but they always have half the dna of the sporophyte</dd>
    <dt>sporophyte</dt>
    <dd>the generation of plants that produces spores. these spores then germinate asexually, into new gametophytes. these are often diploid (2 sets of chromosomes), but they always have twice the dna of the gametophyte</dd>
    <dt>alternating generations</dt>
    <dd>the name for the whole setup of plants and some other organisms, where you have differences between even and odd generations</dd>
